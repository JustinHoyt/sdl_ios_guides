# Example Apps
SDL provides two example apps: one written in Objective-C and one in Swift. Both implement the same features.

The example apps are located in the [sdl_ios](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_ios) repository. To try them, you can download the repository and run the example app targets, or you may use `pod try SmartDeviceLink` with [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) installed on your Mac.

## Connecting to Hardware
To connect the example app to Manticore or another emulator, make sure you are on the `TCP Debug` tab and type in the IP address and port, then press "Connect". The button will turn green when you are connected.

To connect the example app to production or debug hardware, make sure you are on the `iAP` tab and press "Connect". The button will turn green when you are connected.

The example apps implement soft buttons, template text and images, a main menu and submenu, vehicle data, and popup menus.
