## Custom Menus
![Perform Interaction Layout](assets/PerformInteractionListOnly.png)
Custom menus, called **perform interactions**, are one level deep, however, you can create submenus by triggering another perform interaction when the user selects a row in a menu. Perform interactions can be set up to recognize speech, so a user can select an item in the menu by speaking their preference rather than physically selecting the item.

Perform interactions are created by sending two different RPCs. First a `SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet` RPC must be sent. This RPC sends a list of items that will show up in the menu. When the request has been registered successfully, then a `SDLPerformInteraction` RPC is sent. The `SDLPerformInteraction` RPC sends the formatting requirements, the voice-recognition commands, and a timeout command.

#### Create a Set of Custom Menu Items
Each menu item choice defined in `SDLChoice` should be assigned a unique id. The choice set in `SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet` should also have its own unique id.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLChoice* choice = [[SDLChoice alloc] initWithId:<#Unique Id#> menuName:@"<#Menu Title#>" vrCommands:@[@"<#Menu Commands#>"]];

SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet* createRequest = [[SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet alloc] initWithId:<#Unique Id#> choiceSet:@[choice]];

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:createRequest withResponseHandler:^(SDLRPCRequest *request, SDLRPCResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
      // The request was successful, now send the SDLPerformInteraction RPC
    }
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let choice = SDLChoice(id: <#Unique Id#>, menuName: "<#Menu Title#>", vrCommands: ["<#Menu Command#>"])

let createRequest = SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet(id: <#Unique Id#>, choiceSet: [choice])

sdlManager.send(request: createRequest) { (request, response, error) in
    if response?.resultCode == .success {
    		// The request was successful, now send the SDLPerformInteraction RPC
    }
}
```

#### Format the Set of Custom Menu Items
Once the set of menu items has been sent to SDL Core, send a `SDLPerformInteraction` RPC to get the items to show up on the HMI screen.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLPerformInteraction* performInteraction = [[SDLPerformInteraction alloc] initWithInitialPrompt:@"<#Prompt spoken when shown#>" initialText:@"<#Text Displayed When Shown#>" interactionChoiceSetID:<#SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet id#>];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let performInteraction = SDLPerformInteraction(initialPrompt: "<#Prompt spoken when shown#>", initialText: "<#Text Displayed When Shown#>", interactionChoiceSetID: <#SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet id#>)
```

#### Interaction Mode
The interaction mode specifies the way the user is prompted to make a selection and the way in which the userâ€™s selection is recorded. You may wish to use "Both" if the user activates the menu with voice, and "Manual Only" if the user activates the menu with touch.

| Interaction Mode  | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Manual only       | Interactions occur only through the display |
| VR only           | Interactions occur only through text-to-speech and voice recognition |
| Both              | Interactions can occur both manually or through VR |

#### Objective-C
```objc
performInteraction.interactionMode = SDLInteractionModeManualOnly;
```

#### Swift
```swift
performInteraction.interactionMode = .manualOnly
```

#### Manual Interaction Mode

#### Interaction Layout
The items in the perform interaction can be shown as a grid of buttons (with optional images) or as a list of choices.

| Layout Mode      | Formatting Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Icon only        | A grid of buttons with images |
| Icon with search | A grid of buttons with images along with a search field in the HMI |
| List only        | A vertical list  of text |
| List with search | A vertical list of text with a search field in the HMI |
| Keyboard         | A keyboard shows up immediately in the HMI |

!!! NOTE
Keyboard is currently only supported for the navigation app type and its use is slightly different. See [mobile navigation](Mobile Navigation/Keyboard Input) for more details.

#### Objective-C
```objc
performInteraction.interactionLayout = SDLLayoutModeListOnly;
```

#### Swift
```swift
performInteraction.interactionLayout = .listOnly
```

#### Icon Only Interaction Layout

#### Text-to-Speech (TTS)
A text-to-speech chunk is a text phrase or prerecorded sound that will be spoken by the head unit. The text parameter specifies the text to be spoken or the name of the pre-recorded sound. Use the type parameter to define the type of information in the text parameter. The `SDLPerformInteraction` request can have a initial, timeout, and a help prompt.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLTTSChunk* ttsChunk = [[SDLTTSChunk alloc] initWithText:@"<#Text to Speak#>" type:SDLSpeechCapabilitiesText];
performInteraction.initialPrompt = @[ttsChunk];

// or - more easily

performInteraction.initialPrompt = [SDLTTSChunk textChunksFromString:@"<#Text to Speak#>"];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let ttsChunk = SDLTTSChunk(text: "<#Text to Speak#>", type: .text)
performInteraction.initialPrompt = [prompt]

// or - more easily

performInteraction.initialPrompt = SDLTTSChunk.textChunks(from: "<#Text to Speak#>")
```

#### Timeout
The timeout parameter defines the amount of time the menu will appear on the screen before the menu is dismissed automatically by the HMI.

#### Objective-C
```objc
performInteraction.timeout = @30000; // 30 seconds
```

#### Swift
```swift
performInteraction.timeout = 30000 // 30 seconds
```

#### Send the Request
#### Objective-C
```objc
[self.sdlManager sendRequest:performInteraction withResponseHandler:^(SDLRPCRequest *request, SDLRPCResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if (![response isKindOfClass:SDLPerformInteractionResponse.class]) {
        return;
    }

    SDLPerformInteractionResponse* performInteractionResponse = (SDLPerformInteractionResponse*)response;

    if ([performInteractionResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultTimedOut]) {
        // The custom menu timed out before the user could select an item
    } else if ([performInteractionResponse.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        NSNumber* choiceId = performInteractionResponse.choiceID;
        // The user selected an item in the custom menu
    }
}];

```

#### Swift
```swift
sdlManager.send(request: performInteraction) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let performInteractionResponse = response as? SDLPerformInteractionResponse else {
        return
    }

    // Wait for user's selection or for timeout
    if performInteractionResponse.resultCode == .timedOut {
        // The custom menu timed out before the user could select an item
    } else if performInteractionResponse.resultCode == .success {
        let choiceId = performInteractionResponse.choiceID
        // The user selected an item in the custom menu
    }
}
```

#### Delete the Custom Menu
If the information in the menu is dynamic, then the old interaction choice set needs to be deleted with a `SDLDeleteInteractionChoiceSet` RPC before the new information can be added to the menu. Use the interaction choice set id to delete the menu.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLDeleteInteractionChoiceSet* deleteRequest = [[SDLDeleteInteractionChoiceSet alloc] initWithId:<#SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet id#>];

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:deleteRequest withResponseHandler:^(SDLRPCRequest *request, SDLRPCResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
      // The custom menu was deleted successfully
    }
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let deleteRequest = SDLDeleteInteractionChoiceSet(id: <#SDLCreateInteractionChoiceSet id#>)

sdlManager.send(request: deleteRequest) { (request, response, error) in
    if response?.resultCode == .success {
     	// The custom menu was deleted successfully
    }
}
```
