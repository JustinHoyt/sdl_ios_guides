## Calling a Phone Number
Dialing a Phone Number allows you to send a phone number to dial on the user's phone. Regardless of platform (Android or iOS), you must be sure that a device is connected via Bluetooth (even if using iOS/USB) for this RPC to work. If it is not connected, you will receive a REJECTED `resultCode`.

!!! note
DialNumber is an RPC that is usually restricted by OEMs. As a result, the OEM you are connecting to may limit app functionality if not approved for usage.
!!!

### Checking the Result of DialNumber
`DialNumber` has 3 possible results that you should expect:

1. SUCCESS - DialNumber was successfully sent, and a phone call was initiated by the user.
2. REJECTED - DialNumber was sent, and a phone call was cancelled by the user. Also, this could mean that there is no phone connected via Bluetooth.
3. DISALLOWED - Your app does not have permission to use DialNumber.

### Detecting if DialNumber is Available
`DialNumber` is a newer RPC, so there is a possibility that not all head units will support it. To see if `DialNumber` is supported, you may look at `SDLManager`'s `systemCapabilityManager.hmiCapabilities.phoneCall` property after the ready handler is called. 

!!! note
If you need to know how to create and setup `SDLManager`, please see [Getting Started > Integration Basics](Getting Started/Integration Basics).
!!!

#### Objective-C
```objc
BOOL isPhoneCallSupported = NO;

[self.sdlManager startWithReadyHandler:^(BOOL success, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if (!success) {
        NSLog(@"SDL errored starting up: %@", error);
        return;
    }

    SDLHMICapabilities *hmiCapabilities = self.sdlManager.systemCapabilityManager.hmiCapabilities;
    if (hmiCapabilities != nil) {
        isPhoneCallSupported = hmiCapabilities.phoneCall.boolValue;
    }
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
var isPhoneCallSupported = false

sdlManager.start { (success, error) in
    if !success {
        print("SDL errored starting up: \(error.debugDescription)")
        return
    }

    if let hmiCapabilities = self.sdlManager.systemCapabilityManager.hmiCapabilities, let phoneCallsSupported = hmiCapabilities.phoneCall?.boolValue {
        isPhoneCallSupported = phoneCallsSupported
    }
}
```

### How to Use
!!! note
For DialNumber, all characters are stripped except for `0`-`9`, `*`, `#`, `,`, `;`, and `+`
!!!

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLDialNumber *dialNumber = [[SDLDialNumber alloc] init];
dialNumber.number = @"1238675309";

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:dialNumber withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if (error != nil || ![response isKindOfClass:SDLDialNumberResponse.class]) {
        NSLog(@"Encountered Error sending DialNumber: %@", error);
        return;
    }

    SDLDialNumberResponse* dialNumber = (SDLDialNumberResponse *)response;
    SDLResult *resultCode = dialNumber.resultCode;
    if (![resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
		if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultRejected]) {
	        NSLog(@"DialNumber was rejected. Either the call was sent and cancelled or there is no device connected");
	    } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
	        NSLog(@"Your app is not allowed to use DialNumber");
	    } else { 	
	    	NSLog(@"Some unknown error has occured!");
	    }
	    return;
    }

	// Successfully sent!
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let dialNumber = SDLDialNumber()
dialNumber.number = "1238675309"

sdlManager.send(request: dialNumber) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLDialNumberResponse else { return }
    
    if let error = error {
        print("Encountered Error sending DialNumber: \(error)")
        return
    }
    
    if response.resultCode != .success {
        if response.resultCode == .rejected {
            print("DialNumber was rejected. Either the call was sent and cancelled or there is no device connected")
        } else if response.resultCode == .disallowed {
            print("Your app is not allowed to use DialNumber")
        } else {
            print("Some unknown error has occured!")
        }
        return
    }
    
    // Successfully sent!
}
```
