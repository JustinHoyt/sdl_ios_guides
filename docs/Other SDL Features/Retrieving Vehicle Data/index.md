## Get Vehicle Data

Use the SDLGetVehicleData RPC call to get vehicle data. The HMI level must be FULL, LIMITED, or BACKGROUND in order to get data.

Each vehicle manufacturer decides which data it will expose. Please check the `SDLRPCResponse` RPC to find out which data you will have access to in your head unit.

!!! note
You may only ask for vehicle data that is available to your appName & appId combination. These will be specified by each OEM separately.

### Single Time Vehicle Data Retrieval
Using `SDLGetVehicleData`, we can ask for vehicle data a single time, if needed. 

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLGetVehicleData *getVehicleData = [[SDLGetVehicleData alloc] init];
getVehicleData.prndl = @YES;
[self.sdlManager sendRequest:getVehicleData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if (error || ![response isKindOfClass:SDLGetVehicleDataResponse.class]) {
        NSLog(@"Encountered Error sending GetVehicleData: %@", error);
        return;
    }
    
    SDLGetVehicleDataResponse* getVehicleDataResponse = (SDLGetVehicleDataResponse *)response;
    SDLResult *resultCode = getVehicleDataResponse.resultCode;
    if (![resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultSuccess]) {
        if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultRejected]) {
            NSLog(@"GetVehicleData was rejected. Are you in an appropriate HMI?");
        } else if ([resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            NSLog(@"Your app is not allowed to use GetVehicleData");
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Some unknown error has occured!");
        }
        return;
    }
    
    SDLPRNDL *prndl = getVehicleDataResponse.prndl;
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let getVehicleData = SDLGetVehicleData()
getVehicleData.prndl = true
sdlManager.send(getVehicleData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLGetVehicleDataResponse else { return }
    
    if let error = error {
        print("Encountered Error sending GetVehicleData: \(error)")
        return
    }
    
    if !response.resultCode == .success {
        if response.resultCode == .rejected {
            print("GetVehicleData was rejected. Are you in an appropriate HMI?")
        } else if response.resultCode == .disallowed {
            print("Your app is not allowed to use GetVehicleData")
        } else {
            print("Some unknown error has occured!")
        }
        return
    }
    
    guard let prndl = response.prndl else { return }
}
```

### Subscribing to Vehicle Data
Subscribing to vehicle data allows you to get notified whenever we have new data available. This data should not be relied upon being received in a consistent manner. New vehicle data is available roughly every second.

**First**, Register to observe the `SDLDidReceiveVehicleDataNotification` notification: 

#### Objective-C
```objc
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(vehicleDataAvailable:) name:SDLDidReceiveVehicleDataNotification object:nil];
```

#### Swift
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(vehicleDataAvailable(_:)), name: .SDLDidReceiveVehicleData, object: nil)
```

Then send the Subscribe Vehicle Data Request:

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLSubscribeVehicleData *subscribeVehicleData = [[SDLSubscribeVehicleData alloc] init];
subscribeVehicleData.prndl = @YES;

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:subscribeVehicleData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if (![response isKindOfClass:[SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse class]]) {
        return;
    }
    
    SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse *subscribeVehicleDataResponse = (SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse*)response;
    SDLVehicleDataResult *prndlData = subscribeVehicleDataResponse.prndl;
    if (!response.success.boolValue) {
        if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            // Not allowed to register for this vehicle data.
        } else if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultUserDisallowed]) {
            // User disabled the ability to give you this vehicle data
        } else if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultIgnored]) {
            if ([prndlData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeDataAlreadySubscribed]) {
                // You have access to this data item, and you are already subscribed to this item so we are ignoring.
            } else if ([prndlData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeVehicleDataNotAvailable]) {
                // You have access to this data item, but the vehicle you are connected to does not provide it.
            } else {
            	NSLog(@"Unknown reason for being ignored: %@", prndlData.resultCode.value);
            }
        } else if (error) {
            NSLog(@"Encountered Error sending SubscribeVehicleData: %@", error);
        }
        
        return;
    }
    
    // Successfully subscribed
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let subscribeVehicleData = SDLSubscribeVehicleData()
subscribeVehicleData.prndl = true

sdlManager.send(request: subscribeVehicleData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLSubscribeVehicleDataResponse else { return }
    
    guard response.success.boolValue == true else {
        if response.resultCode == .disallowed {
            // Not allowed to register for this vehicle data.
        } else if response.resultCode == .userDisallowed {
            // User disabled the ability to give you this vehicle data
        } else if response.resultCode == .ignored {
            if let prndlData = response.prndl {
                if prndlData.resultCode == .dataAlreadySubscribed {
                    // You have access to this data item, and you are already subscribed to this item so we are ignoring.
                } else if prndlData.resultCode == .vehicleDataNotAvailable {
                    // You have access to this data item, but the vehicle you are connected to does not provide it.
                } else {
                    print("Unknown reason for being ignored: \(prndlData.resultCode)")
                }
            } else {
                print("Unknown reason for being ignored: \(String(describing: response.info))")
            }
        } else if let error = error {
            print("Encountered Error sending SubscribeVehicleData: \(error)")
        }
        return
    }
    
    // Successfully subscribed
}
```

Finally, react to the notification when Vehicle Data is received:

#### Objective-C
``` objc
- (void)vehicleDataAvailable:(SDLRPCNotificationNotification *)notification {
    if (![notification.notification isKindOfClass:SDLOnVehicleData.class]) {
        return;
    }
    
    SDLOnVehicleData *onVehicleData = (SDLOnVehicleData *)notification.notification;
    
    SDLPRNDL *prndl = onVehicleData.prndl;
}
```

#### Swift
```swift
func vehicleDataAvailable(_ notification: SDLRPCNotificationNotification) {
    guard let onVehicleData = notification.notification as? SDLOnVehicleData else {
        return
    }
    
    let prndl = onVehicleData.prndl
}
```

### Unsubscribing from Vehicle Data
Sometimes you may not always need all of the vehicle data you are listening to. We suggest that you only are subscribing when the vehicle data is needed. To stop listening to specific vehicle data items, utilize `SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData`.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData *unsubscribeVehicleData = [[SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData alloc] init];
unsubscribeVehicleData.prndl = @YES;

[self.sdlManager sendRequest:unsubscribeVehicleData withResponseHandler:^(__kindof SDLRPCRequest * _Nullable request, __kindof SDLRPCResponse * _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {
    if (![response isKindOfClass:[SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse class]]) {
        return;
    }

    SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse *unsubscribeVehicleDataResponse = (SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse*)response;
    SDLVehicleDataResult *prndlData = unsubscribeVehicleDataResponse.prndl;

    if (!response.success.boolValue) {
        if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultDisallowed]) {
            // Not allowed to register for this vehicle data, so unsubscribe also will not work.
        } else if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultUserDisallowed]) {
            // User disabled the ability to give you this vehicle data, so unsubscribe also will not work.
        } else if ([response.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLResultIgnored]) {
            if ([prndlData.resultCode isEqualToEnum:SDLVehicleDataResultCodeDataNotSubscribed]) {
                // You have access to this data item, but it was never subscribed to so we ignored it.
            } else {
                NSLog(@"Unknown reason for being ignored: %@", prndlData.resultCode.value);
            }
        } else if (error) {
            NSLog(@"Encountered Error sending UnsubscribeVehicleData: %@", error);
        }
        return;
    }
    
    // Successfully unsubscribed
}];
```

#### Swift
```swift
let unsubscribeVehicleData = SDLUnsubscribeVehicleData()
unsubscribeVehicleData.prndl = true

sdlManager.send(request: unsubscribeVehicleData) { (request, response, error) in
    guard let response = response as? SDLUnsubscribeVehicleDataResponse else { return }
    
    guard response.success.boolValue == true else {
        if response.resultCode == .disallowed {
            
        } else if response.resultCode == .userDisallowed {
            
        } else if response.resultCode == .ignored {
            if let prndlData = response.prndl {
                if prndlData.resultCode == .dataAlreadySubscribed {
                    // You have access to this data item, and you are already unsubscribed to this item so we are ignoring.
                } else if prndlData.resultCode == .vehicleDataNotAvailable {
                    // You have access to this data item, but the vehicle you are connected to does not provide it.
                } else {
                    print("Unknown reason for being ignored: \(prndlData.resultCode)")
                }
            } else {
                print("Unknown reason for being ignored: \(String(describing: response.info))")
            }
        } else if let error = error {
            print("Encountered Error sending UnsubscribeVehicleData: \(error)")
        }
        return
    }
    
    // Successfully unsubscribed
}
```
