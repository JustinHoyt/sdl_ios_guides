## Supporting Haptic Input

SDL now supports "haptic" input, input from something other than a touch screen. This could include trackpads, click-wheels, etc. These kinds of inputs work by knowing which areas on the screen are touchable and focusing on those areas when the user moves the trackpad or click wheel. When the user selects a rect, the center of that area will be "touched".

!!! NOTE
Currently, there are no RPCs for knowing which rect is highlighted, so your UI will have to remain static, without scrolling.
!!!

You will also need to implement touch input support (Mobile Navigation/Touch Input) in order to receive touches of the rects. You must support the automatic focusable item manager in order to receive a touched view back in the `SDLTouchManagerDelegate` in addition to the `CGPoint`.

### Automatic Focusable Rects
SDL has support for automatically detecting focusable rects within your UI and sending that data to the head unit. You will still need to tell SDL when your UI changes so that it can re-scan and detect the rects to be sent.

!!! IMPORTANT
This is *only* supported on iOS 9 devices and above. If you want to support this on iOS 8, see "Manual Focusable Rects" below.
!!!

In order to use the automatic focusable item locator, you must set the `UIWindow` of your streaming content on `SDLStreamingMediaConfiguration.window`. So long as the device is on iOS 9+ and the window is set, the focusable item locator will start running. Whenever your app updates, you will need to send a notification:

#### Objective-C
```objc
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:SDLDidUpdateProjectionView object:nil];
```

#### Swift
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: SDLDidUpdateProjectionView, object: nil)
```

!!! NOTE
SDL can only automatically detect `UIButton`s and anything else that responds `true` to `canBecomeFocused`. This means that custom `UIView` objects will *not* be found. You must send these objects manually, see "Manual Focusable Rects".
!!!

### Manual Focusable Rects
If you need to supplement the automatic focusable item locator, or do all of the location yourself (e.g. devices lower than iOS 9, or views that are not focusable such as custom UIViews or OpenGL views), then you will have to manually send and update the focusable rects using `SDLSendHapticData`. This request, when sent replaces all current rects with new rects; so, if you want to clear all of the rects, you would send the RPC with an empty array. Or, if you want to add a single rect, you must re-send all previous rects in the same request.

Usage is simple, you create the rects using `SDLHapticRect`, add a unique id, and send all the rects using `SDLSendHapticData`.

#### Objective-C
```objc
SDLRectange *viewRect = [[SDLRectangle alloc] initWithCGRect:view.bounds];
SDLHapticRect *hapticRect = [[SDLHapticRect alloc] initWithId:1 rect:viewRect];
SDLSendHapticData *hapticData = [[SDLSendHapticData alloc] initWithHapticRectData:@[hapticRect]];

[self.sdlManager.sendRequest:hapticData];
```

#### Swift
```swift
guard let viewRect = SDLRectange(cgRect: view.bounds) else { return }
let hapticRect = SDLHapticRect(id: 1, rect: viewRect)
let hapticData = SDLSendHapticData(hapticRectData: [hapticRect])

self.sdlManager.send(hapticData)
```
